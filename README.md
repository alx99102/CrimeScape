## Inspiration
Our inspiration to create the app about crime statistics in Montreal stemmed from a shared sense of responsibility and a strong desire to enhance the safety and well-being of our community. Understanding the transformative power of accessible information, we saw an opportunity to not only clarify and demystify crime data but also to empower our fellow residents with knowledge and awareness. This project transcends the realm of a mere technological endeavor; it is a testament to our commitment to harnessing innovation for the greater good. By pooling our skills and passion, we are not just crafting a useful tool â€“ we are forging a beacon of awareness and a catalyst for positive change. Through our collaborative efforts, we aim to contribute to a safer, more connected Montreal, where information serves as a shield and a unifying force for its people.

## What it does
CrimeScape is an app that can help anyone visualize the current and past crime rates in Montreal, as well as forecasting future crime rates in the city. Using open data provided by the city, we provide a heatmap visualization of where crimes occur, with user choice on what crimes to visualize, the time of day it occurs in and the date range the crime occured in. When viewing our crime rate predictions for the future, the user may instead choose the month to be viewed. 

## Significant region prediction
Our initial idea was ambitious, we planned to implement newly conducted research of graph neural networks in a spatiotemporal setting to conduct time series forecasting on crime rates on the island of montreal. Although this seemed possible with the current dataset, its implementation was quite challenging. Recent research conducted in 2021 titled "Crime Prediction with Graph Neural Networks and Normal Distributions" by Selim Furkan Tekin and Suleyman S. Kozatwas our first resource in understanding and tackling this problem. Firstly, when constructing graph neural networks it is vital in understanding your personal version of the problem based on your dataset, as node and edge features have to be planned out and designed beforehand which was a mistake our group make when tackling this problem. Tekin and Kozatwas split the city in an I X J cells which represents some longitude and latitude similarly to us. They then transformed these cells into regions where each region contained some cluster of cells. Each cell will have a matrix to represent the crimes that occurred in that region at some time slot.  This set up is very methodical as the nodes of the graphs and edges are fixed all that changes are the features or rather the probabilities of crimes being committed in a region. This would have been the best way to structure the problem; however, due to the 24 hour time period constructing this complicated of a model to handle this type of data seemed to be unrealistic as the competition progressed. 

Instead we opted to forecast edge labels which contained data such as longitude latitude and a temporal aspect. When structuring the graph there are two distinct labels for the nodes time, and location which is represented by longitude and latitude. All times and location nodes were connected by edges which represent the location and time a crime occurred. From here the model turns into a classification problem where it attempts to predict the feature representation of an edge label. From this prediction a longitude and latitude can be extracted from it. This geolocation represents the most significant feature in the network.

## The Model
The model can be broken down into three types of layer:
-**SAGEConv**
This layer acts as a convolutional layer than performs significantly better or large networks, which was highlighted in "Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs" by William L. Hamilton, Rex Ying, Jure Leskovec. From our personal testing training and test accuracy increased by 12 percent over 100 epochs. 
-**BatchNormalization**
Enables stability in training and convergence
-**Dropout**
Prevents overfitting of the network

The train test validation split was conducted through a Random link split.

This validifies the output as: The split is performed such that the training split does not include edges in validation and test splits; and the validation split does not include edges in the test split.

Over multiple tests convergence was achieved quickly with no deviations in results over the course of development.

## How we built it
This application was built using various modern technologies, listed below:
### Backend
- **Python**: Flask web-app links the backend to frontend through RESTFUL api.
- **Cloudflare**: Deployment (TBD)
- **MongoDB Atlas**: store the crime data pulled from the open data provided by the city of Montreal
- **Jupyter**: Used in development and training of our Graph AI model.
- **Google Cloud**: Google maps javascript API, Google Colab platform used for developing the AI dataset and model
